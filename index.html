                    My name is Vlad Musienko, I'm a web designer. I love to draw and all that is connected with the
                    design. In
                    this area a long time ago and during this time I managed to create several successful projects used
                    by
                    people all over the world.

                    I love the simplicity in the design of web sites. As I see it,people, it's like my work. Naturally
                    do not want to rest on our laurels and will continue further studies to improve soybean skills,
                    creating
                    new interesting creative projects.

                        <p>Lately, I often create templates for WordPress. The portfolio is the presentation and the

                            people in its definition as a person and specialist.</p>
